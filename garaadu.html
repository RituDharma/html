       	<i><b>“You have to come here in winter to try ratalu!!”</b></i> Large chunks of the starchy purple yam,locally known as <i><b>garaadu</b></i>, stacked around frying pans. Sliced to order and then dunked in hot oil, ratalu is deep-fried to a uniform golden-brown and generously smothered in red chilli powder or <i><b>giravan</b></i>(a local spicy powder). Crisp on the surface with just the right amount of give, the ratalu will sing in your lips with its hing-heavy spice coating. Like the best winter snacks, it will also fill you with a sense of warmth and wellbeing.
